    description= _ "The people of Theria are known for their pursuit of spirituality. The Therian have also learned to greatly respect nature from their neighbors the Warg. Many Therian attune their spirits to animals which they revere. These Therian are capable of harnessing their inner spiritual power to shift into the animal to which they are attuned.

Therian who value strength, power, and intensity attune to the wild cats.  These Therian are brutal in combat when in their attuned form, using their claws, or sometimes even jaws, to shred their enemies and protect their people."
