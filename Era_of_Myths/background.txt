========= Celestials =========
The Celestials are not human, but a humanoid creature which grows wings. Not every Celestial can fly however,
as most Celestials wings are vestigal and deteriorate, falling off in adolescence. The Celestials are a
very spiritual race, believing that there is power in Light and Darkness; and they choose to side with the
Light. They believe in this so heavily that they keep their settlements lit at night through bonfires and
the aid of a rare species of pixie that radiates light from it's skin. They name these pixies Light Archons
and worship them as demi-gods. Celestials also believe in the saying "the whole is greater than the sum of
its parts." Working together they can achieve great accomplishments quickly. 

Celestials who grow their wings are known as Winged Ones, and are treated with a higher level of respect for
their fitness and majesty. With this respect comes a greater expectation however, and although most thrive on
this, some do not.... Celestials who lose their wings are then seperated into 2 groups: warriors and
non-warriors. The warriors of Celestial society not only protect the Celestials, but they also go forth on
crusades to spread the Light to other regions as well. Non-warriors, though capable of fighting, spend their
time worshipping, farming, and expanding their settlements. 

Not all Celestials fit into this society so well. Some who lose their wings become so maddened that they
reject their society and turn to it's opposite. Some warriors who have horrific experiences on the battlefield
cannot return to their former beliefs and either join forces with those with a darker view, or simply wander
off. Then there are the Winged-Ones who feel pressured to live up to the expectations of their society...these
Celestials can and have reacted in terrible ways against this pressure. Some have gone mad, torn their eyes
out to escape seeing the light and turn to the arts of darkness. Some turn their resentment of their fellow
Celestials' expectations into rage and become berserkers attacking everything that reminds them of this
pressure. These outcast Celestials often find allies in a race of blue-skinned creatures who practice the arts
of darkness to create and summon horrific Aberrations to do their bidding. It is among these creatures they
find a second home.....


========= Aberrations =========
These creatures are born blind and so stick to living in swamps and underground. They have developed an
ability, like bats, to create sonic waves to "see" their surroundings. They stand about 5-feet tall, but their
hunched stance puts them at a solid 4-feet. Their 4 fingers end in solid, ground-tearing claws. 

These creatures, lacking sight, hunger to gain power and "vision" in other areas. Experimenting and magic and
alchemical endeavours, these creatures summon and creatures creates to do their bidding in their quest for
even greater power. Some of these creatures actually have been born with sight and simply feign blindness in
order to avoid the jealousy of their bretheren. Those who are caught are forced to rip their eyes out to
level the playing field. It is rumored that these "Eyeless" ones become endowed with even greater powers
than sight....
